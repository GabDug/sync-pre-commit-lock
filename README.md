PDM plugin to sync your pre-commit versions with your lockfile and automatically install pre-commit hooks.

## Features

- üîÅ Sync pre-commit versions with your lockfile
- ‚è© Run every time you run the lockfile is updated, not as a pre-commit hook
- üîÑ Install pre-commit hooks automatically, no need to run `pre-commit install` manually

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by @floatingpurr's [sync_with_pdm](https://github.com/floatingpurr/sync_with_pdm/) and [sync_with_poetry](https://github.com/floatingpurr/sync_with_poetry/).

The inspiration to install pre-commit hooks automatically comes from @vstrimaitis's [poetry-pre-commit-plugin](https://github.com/vstrimaitis/poetry-pre-commit-plugin/)
