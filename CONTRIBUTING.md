# Contributing

All contributions are welcome!

## New features and bug fixes

If you are not sure what to do, check the README roadmap for ideas.

If you have something in mind, don't hesitate to open an issue to discuss it.

PRs are welcomed without prior discussion, but please open an issue if you want to work on something big, to avoid wasting time.

## Repository to package mapping

Contributions to the mapping of repos are welcomed, if the projects have enough usage to be worth it.

If not, you can still manually add them to your `pyproject.toml` file.
