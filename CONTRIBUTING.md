# Contributing

All contributions are welcome!

## New features and bug fixes

If you are not sure what to do, check the README roadmap for ideas.

If you have something in mind, please try to open an issue to discuss it first.

## Repository to package mapping

Contributions to the mapping of repos are welcomed, if the projects have enough usage to be worth it.

If not, you can still manually add them to your `pyproject.toml` file.
